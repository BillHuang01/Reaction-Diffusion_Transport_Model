# Reaction-Diffusion Transport Model

This repository provides the python implementation of the reaction-diffusion model for the vapor phase infiltration (VPI) process in our paper "[Reactionâˆ’Diffusion Transport Model to Predict Precursor Uptake and Spatial Distribution in Vapor-Phase Infiltration Processes][1]". The MATLAB implementation is also available [here][2]. 

The jupyter notebook "simulation.ipynb" can also be run on [binder][3].
